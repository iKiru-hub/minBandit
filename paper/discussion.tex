In the context of human behaviour, it has been observed that the adopted policies vary considerably \cite{steyversBayesianAnalysisHuman2009a}. However, the subjects seems able to integrate environmental uncertainty and trial generalization in their strategy, and Bayesian algorithms are generally a good fit for the observed behaviour \cite{schulzFindingStructureMultiarmed2020, zhangForgetfulBayesMyopic2013}.
